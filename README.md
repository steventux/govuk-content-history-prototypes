### Inline example

[Inline change history linked to change notes](https://steventux.github.io/govuk-content-history-prototypes/enhanced-change-notes/inline-changes.html)

This static prototype represents a rendering of a GOV.UK page with change history.
The prototype is designed to explore the technical feasibility of rendering change history
in a current GOV.UK page.
Considerations around page size would mean that this history could be requested
asynchronously with graceful degradation to a page of changes.
